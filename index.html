<h2>As in 2020, the majority of the victims were trans women. 16 were murdered, 13 were not older than 35 years.
</h2>
<h2>“Homicides and / or femicides due to the sexual orientation and gender identity of the victim do not constitute an isolated situation in the lives of these people; on the contrary, they constitute the most tragic conclusion of an entire history of violence and the cruelest manifestation of a patriarchal and hetero-normalized system, which makes use of prejudice and hatred to silence these diversities ”, says the harsh report of the Defensoria del Pueblo.
</h2>
<h2>In addition, the report states that the population with diverse sexual orientation and gender identity is at greater risk if it works in the defense and leadership of the human rights of that population.
</h2>
<h2>For the Defensoria del Pueblo, the spread of messages against the LGBTQI community from social media to pamphlets, alongside the speech of some people who hold public office, produce negative image of that community and. They add that these messages could be directly related to the increase in threats from actors of the inner armed conflict in Colombia who attack the LGBTQI leaders and organizations, preventing this population from having an active participation in the Peace Process.
